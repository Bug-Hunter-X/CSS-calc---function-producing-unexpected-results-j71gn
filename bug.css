The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it doesn't work as expected when dealing with multiple units or complex expressions. For example, using `calc(100% - 50px)` might not produce the correct result if the parent element's width isn't accurately calculated or if there are unexpected margins or paddings.
